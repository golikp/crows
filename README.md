The file pilot.csv contains raw observational ethogram data. <p>
[Figure2AB.R] (Figure2AB.R) contains R code used to generate Figure 2 from the data. Note, that panel B must be generated in an interactive R session due to the limitations of the ggpairs() function.<p>
The code in pilot_box.R can be used to generate comparisons for all the behaviors, including those not shown in Figure 2 of the paper due to the lack of significant change. The plots will be grouped by behavior category.
